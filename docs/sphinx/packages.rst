Packages
========

The packages listed here are build or runtime dependencies required by
various super-build components.  Most are optionally provided by the
super-build, but some will require manual installation.  Where manual
installation is desired or required, the appropriate packages provided
by common package managers are listed, as well as links to the
upstream sources or binaries for systems without suitable prebuilt
packages.
